# bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze patterns and usage of Citi bikes in New York City. This analysis was conducted to present information to key stakeholders to provide them with information to determine if Des Moines is a good potential location to bring a similar bike sharing service.
## Results

Our first data visualization allowed us to understand how much data we were looking at. The following data visualizations are comprised of 2,344,224 rides.

We can also see that of those rides, males are contributing largely to the service by being the ones who take a majority of those rides.

From this image we can see the most popular starting locations of rides based on those dots that are larger in size and darker in color.

While it is important to know who is using the bikes and where they are using them, we must also look at how long individuals are using the bike sharing service. It seems that users of the service do not use the bike for more than an hour with a majority of bike trips happening in the first 20 minutes of picking up the bike from the starting location. We can also see that males(yellow) take more rides which aligns with the second data visualization that shows a majority of the service users are male.

When looking at bike usage times, we can see that bike usage spikes immediately before and immediately following business hours suggesting that this is popular source for transportation to and from the workplace. This data is also helpful to determine the least popular times of usage to create a maintanence schedule for the bikes that does not interfere with the service and does not create a bike shortage during active times.

In line with the gender gap and the previous visualization, we can see the most active hours remain the same for both genders yet are more popular among men as they are the ones using the service more.

Additionally, we can see that the most frequent users of the service are subscribers. This leads us to believe that there is not a large tourist population using the bike-sharing service and the largest users most likely live in the area. 

## Summary
These data visualizations show us that the male population make up over 50% of the data.  This is important to understand so the data is properly interpreted. We can see that males are more frequent users meaning the data showing their usage may be stronger. Looking at bike-usage as a whole, we can see that the service is most active in the weekdays before 9 am and after 5 pm which we can interpet to mean that Citibikes is a popular mode of work transportation. Additional visualizations that may better help stakeholders understand if this is a good business venture for Des Moines is to compare the population. Stakeholders will need to understand the city population sizes, transportation habits and city geography. It may also be benefical to know commute times. For example, in NYC we know that users tend to rent the bikes for less than 30 minutes a trip, as the most popular hours are around business hours we can also interpret that a majority of work commutes take about 30 minutes or less.
